### Node.js splits into two


Node.js, an open source, cross-platform evented I/O runtime environment for JavaScript, has been a popular coding tool for individuals and enterprise products. Founded by Ryan Dahl, and secondly contributed by Isaac Schlueter - the project has a total of **549 contributors** till date.

As of recently, there has been an active fork of Node.js that promises to speed up development in the fork-name of <a href="http://iojs.org/" target="_blank">Io.js</a>.

### Reasons and Symptoms

"We don’t want to have just one person who’s appointed by a company making decisions, we want contributors to have more control, to seek consensus.” says Mikeal Rogers, a Node community organizer involved in the fork.

Node.js has been at 0.10.x since early 2013 while Node 0.12 and 1.0 releases were being talked about well over a year ago by former BDFL Isaac Schlueter (now at npm). 

One of the many symptoms of that slow development process is that Node.js is basically running an **unsupported version of V8** (<a href="https://twitter.com/jmayer/status/532971494695907328" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/jmayer/status/532971494695907328</a>). It seems that the patches from upstream of V8 are not cleanly applicable within the development process.

### Why Io.js

Io.js represents a technical exploration by key developers in the Node core community with the intent to accelerate the release of recent technical innovations, many of which were developed by **StrongLoop** developers.

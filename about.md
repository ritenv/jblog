### Presently developing on frontend technologies at Safarna.

Riten Vagadiya is a Dubai-based software developer with special feelings for JavaScript. Originally from India, he studied high school, college and life-knowledge in Dubai.

Starting with developing Flash-based logic-driven games and hacking pals' computers, to on-the-job and freelance projects on PHP and related frameworks, he pursued his journey through programming with passion to end up in a paradise of JavaScript where he found his home. Supporter of NodeJS, AngularJS, MongoDB and the Express framework, he is (trying towards) building hobby projects that would make a difference.

In late 2014, he joined the folks at Safarna.
